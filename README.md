# BikeGAN

This is the fork of [BicycleGAN](https://junyanz.github.io/BicycleGAN/) which is used to train and run GANs for [FrankenGAN](github.com).

'test_interactive.py', listens to the '.'/input' folders for new inputs, and writes them to './output'. Once it is running, set [chordatlas](https://github.com/twak/chordatlas)' bikeGAN file location (in the settings menu) to the bikeGAN root directory.
